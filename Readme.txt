Our Project is Students Academic Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques.


Programming language used : Python

Dataset used in the project is also attached.
'studentsdetails' is the dataset in the form csv formt.

Implementation files are attached are in .ipynb format in Project code folder.

Software setup :
We have used Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda software for coding and implementation part.

The system has to be installed with Anaconda software. Below is the link:
https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86_64.exe

Along with this software, libraries like numpy, pandas and sklearn are to be installed to run the code.
To install any required library, we need to go to anaconda prompt and install them.

After setting up all the software, steps to be followed :

1.Open the Anaconda software. Software interface pops up.
2.Select Jupyter notebook and launch it.
3.It will be opened as local host in either internet explorer or chrome browser.
4.All the folders are now displayed, we need to select the folder containing these files.
5.Example, in our system it is as : C:/Users/Desktop/mlproject/files
6.The implementation files are in .ipynb format and will be opened by jupyter notebook with a click.
7.Firstly the data set has to be loaded by specifying path location of folder containing the dataset. using read_csv library our dataset will be loaded.
8.Now to run these files, We have certain options in top left.
9.To run file, kernel-----> (Restart and Run all) or press run button.
10.To Create new file, Go to file/new notebook/python3.
11.While executing code, you can find kernel is busy at the top right and is empty when code is run.
